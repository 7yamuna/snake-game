# Snake Game Project

## Description

This repository contains a classic Snake game implemented in Java. The game is a simple, yet engaging, arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. The objective is to maneuver the snake to eat the food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming skills including GUI development, event handling, and game logic implementation.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay**: Control the snake using the arrow keys to navigate and consume food.
- **Growing Difficulty**: The snake grows longer each time it eats, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, based on the number of food items consumed.
- **Game Over Detection**: Detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body to end the game.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Utilizes Java's Swing framework for rendering the game window and graphics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd snake-game-java
   ```
3. Compile the Java source files:
   ```sh
   javac src/*.java
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```sh
   java src.Main
   ```

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
  - Up Arrow: Move Up
  - Down Arrow: Move Down
